# Project for course Smart Phone Sensing
## APP1
Use KNN to localize in 4 cells.
Recognize activities: still ,walk, jump.
## APP2
Use Beysian filtering to localize in 9 cells.
Both serial filtering and parallel filtering have been implemented but serial is the final method in the APP.
No motion model has been implemented.
## APP3
Use particle filtering to localiza in 9 cells with motion model.

## Data processing
including data cleaning, sample filtering, signal trimming, Gaussian kernel, feature selection, radio map, etc
